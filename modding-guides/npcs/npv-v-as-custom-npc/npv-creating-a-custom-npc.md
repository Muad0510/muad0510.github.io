# NPV: Creating a custom NPC

## Summary

**Created by @manavortex**\
**Published May 13 2023**


As much of the information here has been documented in [other guides](../appearances-change-the-looks.md), the information below will be kept initially brief. Might write more to a later point, but there is a lot of [documentation](../../../developers/vehicles/archive/.app-file-appearanceresource.md) already.


This page is a part of the [NPV guide](./). It will show you how to use the [provided example project](./#preparation) to create a custom NPC for Cyberpunk 2077, whom you can then spawn with AppearanceMenuMod.


This guide assumes that&#x20;

* you already have a head mesh (see [this section](npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md) otherwise)
* that you're using a set of default paths (if not, read the last paragraph of this box)
  * the corresponding files are in either of these folders\
    `tutorial\npv\your_female_character\head` \
    `tutorial\npv\your_male_character\head`
  * the meshes are named like their in-game equivalents, e.g. `h0_000_pwa_c__basehead.mesh`



It's not a problem if you use your own custom paths. You just need to keep that in mind when changing the provided .ent and .app file, as your paths will be different from those in the examples.



You can pack the Wolvenkit project and spawn Tutorial Man and Tutorial Woman via AMM to check out your progress.


## The .lua file

We're registering our NPC with AppearanceMenuMod via a .lua file, which needs to end up in AMM's `Custom Entities` folder. The full path in the Cyberpunk directory will be this:

`bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\AppearanceMenuMod\Collabs\Custon Entities`

I have prepared two example files in the Wolvenkit's project's `resources`. Delete the one that you aren't using, then let's take a look at the other one:

`tutorial_custom_female_character.lua`

`tutorial_custom_male_character.lua`

### The file structure

This is the file content for the female example:

```lua
return {
  -- Your beautiful name :)
  modder = "tutorial",

  -- This must be UNIQUE so be creative!
  -- NO SPACES OR SYMBOLS ALLOWED
  unique_identifier = "tutorial_female_character",

  -- This is the info about your new entity
  entity_info = {
  -- name: The name that will be shown in the Spawn tab
    name = "Tutorial Woman",
  -- path: The path to your entity file. Must use double slash bars \\
    path = "tutorial\\npv\\your_female_character\\ops\\your_female_character.ent",
  -- record: This is the TweakDB record that will be used to add your character. More information below.
    record = "Character.afterlife_merc_fast_melee_w_hard",
  -- type: Character or Vehicle
    type = "Character",
  -- customName: Set this to true if you want the name you set here to appear in AMM Scan tab.
    customName = true
  },

  appearances = {
    "tutorial_woman_casual", 
    "tutorial_woman_business", 
  },  

  -- Here you can pass a list of attributes from different records to be copied to your new character.
  -- More information below.
  attributes = {
  },
}
```

It loads our [root entity](npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md#the-root-entity) from  `tutorial\npv\your_female_character\ops\your_female_character.ent`. That's the file which tells the game what to load.

You can and should change this file — see the inline documentation for how to do that.

## The root entity

You find the root entity for your character here:

```
tutorial\npv\your_female_character\ops\your_female_character.ent
tutorial\npv\your_male_character\ops\your_male_character.ent
```


[Would you like to know more?](../../../modding-know-how/files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/#root-entity)


The root entity hooks up your .app file and the appearance names in the .lua file, and that's about everything there is to say about it. Here's how it looks:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_root_entity.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Adjust entries as needed. If you want to </p></figcaption></figure>

If you want to add more appearances:

* duplicate an existing entry
* change the last key `name` to match the one in your .lua
* change the first key `appearanceName` to the one you want to put in your `.app`

Let's look at the .app file now.

## The app file


[Would you like to know more?](../../../developers/vehicles/archive/.app-file-appearanceresource.md)


This is where all of your NPC's components are defined — stuff like which rig they use, their facial expression set, the shadow they cast, but also their hair and equipment. For details, see the .app file's [overview page](../../../developers/vehicles/archive/.app-file-appearanceresource.md), for another guide on this, see [here](../appearances-change-the-looks.md).

It looks like this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_app_structure.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How do I know what to put?

To find out which variants and appearances to use, I suggest that you use NoraLee's excellent [NPV Part Picker](https://noraleedoes.neocities.org/npv/npv\_part\_picker). It will look like this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_guide_part_picker_preview.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Find it at <a href="https://noraleedoes.neocities.org/npv/npv_part_picker">https://noraleedoes.neocities.org/npv/npv_part_picker</a></p></figcaption></figure>


This is where you select your eyebrow appearance — open up the mesh file and expand the first list `appearances`. There you can see a bunch of colours and numbers. The numbers correspond with the character editor, and you can look the colours up [here](../../../modding-know-how/references-lists-and-overviews/hair.md).


Each of the prepared .app files has two appearances, `casual` and `business`. I tried hooking up all the components for you (might have forgotten some). In that case, you simply duplicate any of the entSkinnedMeshComponents and change `depotPath` and `apperance`:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_app_details.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Customizing Cyberware

When selecting a different cyberware than the preconfigured one, you **have** to set the appearance name, or the whole thing will show up in grey. The appearance names are usually identical to the cyberware (`cyberware_01`, `cyberware_02` etc.), but if you are uncertain, you can also open the mesh file and check the `appearances` list at the top.

### Customizing piercings and chrome: Chunkmasks

You have the full piercing or cyberware file, but you're only using parts of it — yet the game stubbornly shows you the whole mesh.&#x20;

Fortunately, you don't have to edit it in Blender, because you can hide the parts you aren't using via chunkmasks. \
Find the `piercing` or `cyberware` component in your `.app` file:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_piercings_chunkmask_1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is where you can turn off submeshes</p></figcaption></figure>

#### How do I know which numbers to put?

You can see that inside the .mesh file (which you can see in the component's `depotPath`). Open it in Wolvenkit, then switch to the `Mesh Preview` tab and toggle the checkboxes on the right; those directly correspond to the boxes you need to uncheck in the `.app` file:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_piercings_chunkmask_2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Here we see the indices of these three submeshes: this is what we need to uncheck in the .app file</p></figcaption></figure>

To hide those bits in the .app, we simply need to uncheck the corresponding boxes - check the previous screnshot!

## Hair

This section will teach you how to find the necessary components to add the right hair to your NPV.



1. Delete the current hair from the .app — there should be 2-3 components, their names will start with either `hair_` or `hh_0`
2. Find the correct hair mesh. You have three options for this:
   1. Looking it up on [our nifty list](../../../modding-know-how/references-lists-and-overviews/hair.md#name-in-files-by-index)
   2. Using [NoraLee's NPV Part Picker](https://noraleedoes.neocities.org/npv/npv\_part\_picker)&#x20;
   3. Filtering the files and clicking through their previews: \
      female: `base\characters\common\hair > wa_ > .mesh > !shadow`\
      male: `base\characters\common\hair > ma_ > .mesh > !shadow`
3. Enter the name of the hair mesh that you want to use into the Asset Browser's search bar (see next screenshot) and hit Return.
4. Once you have found the correct mesh file, right-click it and select "Find Files Using This":

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_finding_hair_files.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4.  This will give you a list of files, which you can mostly ignore. The only thing we care about is the hair's `.ent` file:

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_hair_filtering.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is how you find the hair's .ent file</p></figcaption></figure>
5.  Open the `.ent` file and expand the `components` array. You will find three components in there, which you can now copy over to your `.app`!

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/npv_hair_ent_file.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Copy these and move them over to your .app</p></figcaption></figure>

### And that's the gist of it!

Go forth and create custom apperances!&#x20;

You can [check this guide](../appearances-change-the-looks.md), or look through the .app files for other NPCs for ideas. If you need further details, I highly recommend checking out NoraLee's [much more detailed tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clFJhpi7H5jk73vUQPnjIwjkuQV6VnYkKMoXt1eYMb0/edit), which will also give you all the context you could possibly need.

For guides on how to export a whole animated character to Blender, you can check [here](https://wiki.redmodding.org/wolvenkit/guides/modding-community/exporting-to-blender/exporting-rigs-and-anims).&#x20;


Please remember that **before sharing your NPV**, you **have** to change the paths! At the very least, rename the `tutorial` folders inside of `archive` and `resources` to your user name and then do a [fulltext search and replace in json](../../everything-else/moving-and-renaming-in-existing-projects.md).



Don't forget, you can pack the Wolvenkit project and spawn Tutorial Man and Tutorial Woman via AMM to check out your progress.
