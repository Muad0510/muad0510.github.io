# NPV - V as custom NPC

**Created by @manavortex**\
**Published May 13 2023**

This guide will show you how to do the following things:&#x20;

* Setting up a Wolvenkit project with the prepared example files
* Creating your V's head in Blender (has its own [sub-page](npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md))
* Adding them as an NPC to spawn them with AppearanceMenuMod (has its own sub-page)

#### Difficulty:

Easy, but not trivial: you don't need any prior knowledge, but the whole structure is complex, and if you make mistakes, you will end up missing files.

**It uses the following versions:**

* Cyberpunk 2077 game version >= 1.6
* [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/Wolvenkit/releases) >= 8.9.1 â€” the Nightly version from [2023-04-29](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases/releases/tag/8.9.1-nightly.2023-04-29) is stable.

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
You can not use the current release 8.9.0 for this! But the Nightly is perfectly OK :)&#x20;
{% endhint %} -->

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) 3.5.1 (anything >= 3.4 should work)
* [AppearanceMenuMod](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/790) >= 2.1

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial should cover your basic needs, but there are many more guides and resources about NPV creation outside of this wiki. You can find them [here](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/modding-guides/community-guides/npvs-v-as-npc-custom-npcs).&#x20;
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
None of this would have been possible without **NoraLee**, who pioneered the process and taught me everything that I needed to know to set up these tools. This guide doesn't use any of their resources, but a lot of their knowledge. For the full guide with all edge-cases, bells, whistles and context, see their [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R-knopKMhHDZuokPKaTt0nIDArXcQdrb).&#x20;

This is the speedrun version. If you want extra details and context, **please check Nora's Google Doc**.

## Preparation

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
At the time of writing this guide, the most recent Wolvenkit release is 8.9.0, which doesn't yet support the .morphtarget export! You will have to install a Nightly version, for example the one from [2023-04-29](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases/releases/tag/8.9.1-nightly.2023-04-29) (which is perfectly stable, the next release is just not quite ready yet).
{% endhint %} -->

I have prepared an example project ([mana's mega](https://mega.nz/file/aVETXTaB#gqKTnP\_lBNxe0b1w9b8TM5agENIIIAAxyLmMd8Kb6l8) | Nexus) for you again, but due to the complexity of V's head mesh, you have to do a little bit of prep work here.

Don't worry, I'll walk you through it step by step.

### The character preset

To create a face, we need to know the following numeric values from the character creator:&#x20;

* Eyes
* Eyebrows
* Nose
* Mouth
* Jaw
* Ears

Find the mirror in V's apartment and note them down, or load a savegame in [Cybercat](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/718).

### Setting up the files

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
**Body gender:**

As a rule of thumb, I'll document the process for an NPV with a female body gender, because ~~as we all know, the other doesn't exist~~ I have one of those. In doubt, double-check paths.
{% endhint %} -->

1. Download the example project of files from mana's mega or Nexus and load up your Wolvenkits
2. In **Windows Explorer**, find the prepared folders per body gender:

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">body gender</th><th>file path</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>female</td><td><code>tutorial\npv\your_female_character</code></td></tr><tr><td>male</td><td><code>tutorial\npv\your_male_character</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

3. Delete the one you're not using (do one project per NPC. No, really, I mean it.)

Now it's time to do the actual work.&#x20;

* If you want to create your V's head for Cyberpunk, read on [here](npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md)
* If you already have a head mesh and just want to set up the file structure, read on [here](npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md)

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
Please remember that before sharing your NPV, you **have** to change the paths! At the very least, rename the `tutorial` folders inside of `archive` and `resources` to your user name and then do a [fulltext search and replace in json](../../everything-else/moving-and-renaming-in-existing-projects.md).
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
At any time during the guide, you can install the Wolvenkit project and spawn **Tutorial Man** and **Tutorial Woman** via AMM to check out your progress.
