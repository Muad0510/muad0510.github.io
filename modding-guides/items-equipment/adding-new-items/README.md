# Adding new items

## Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

**Created by @manavortex**\
**Published November 04 2022**

This guide will walk you through **adding your own items** to Cyberpunk 2077, which can then be spawned via console.&#x20;

**It uses the following versions:**

* Cyberpunk 2077 game version 1.6.2 Hotfix
* [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases/releases) >= 8.9.0
* [TweakXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197) 1.1.4
* [ArchiveXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198) 1.4.3
* [Red4ext](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380) 1.12.0

**Assumed skill level:** \
You should be able to find your way around WolvenKit, but I aim to keep this as noob-friendly as possible.

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
**For experienced modders**

I have repeatedly observed that newbies are fine with this guide, while people who know how to mod are not. Watch out for **boxes like this one** to avoid those pitfalls.
{% endhint %} -->

_The guide was created after reading_ [_this one_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQjb8MpimB9LDNl7y1iTXH13MUvMrKsH/view) _and being left with a bunch of question marks. To get a deeper understanding, refer to the initial guide and follow the linked resources or consult ArchiveXL's_ [_documentation_](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl)_._

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
You can find a tool to troubleshoot your ArchiveXL mod [here](https://github.com/solaarTW/DeepAssetDiscovery/releases).
{% endhint %} -->

## Grab the example files

* Create a new Wolvenkit project
* Download the prepared files from [manavortex's mega](https://mega.nz/file/TYMQUa7b#60y1HLM-BYvS5Eb1uccpq1hq48UwY6VLN5FLHpO8HtI) or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/8268) and extract them to the root of your new project (overwriting the "source" folder

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
**If you would rather start from scratch:** Check the detailed instructions [here](adding-new-items-files-from-scratch.md).

For an explanation of the file structure, see the [item structure explained](archive-xl-item-structure-explained.md) subpage.

Understanding is **not required** as long as you follow the guide to the letter.
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
⚠ Do not edit those files outside of WolvenKit, and whatever you do, do not let Microsoft Excel touch the clothing.csv! ⚠
{% endhint %} -->

### You should now have the following files:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/archive\_xl\_adding\_items\_file\_structure.png)

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
The example files are set up to load a shirt with two different appearances, which you can spawn directly:&#x20;

`Game.AddToInventory("Items.my_custom_shirt_redwhite")`

`Game.AddToInventory("Items.my_custom_shirt_redblack")`
{% endhint %} -->

### Start the game

Press "Install and Launch" in WolvenKit. This will do the following things:

1. Copy all supported file entries from `source` to their destination under `packed`, overwriting older files (but not removing files that you renamed!)
2. Copy all files under `packed` into your game directory, again overwriting older files
3. Launch the game.

You should now see your item. If not, consult the section [**Troubleshooting**](./#troubleshooting) below, or retrace your steps and make sure that everything works before proceeding to the step below.

## Great! You added items! Now what?

You can now

* customize your [preview images](adding-items-preview-images.md)
* [Add an atelier store](adding-items-atelier-integration.md)
*

## Diagram

This is how everything connects. Looks pretty scary, but you can find a step by step breakdown on the [corresponding wiki page](archive-xl-item-structure-explained.md).

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1QzZMP.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Don't panic, we've got this.</p></figcaption></figure>



## Adding an appearance (example: blackblue)

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
Before you add an appearance, make sure that your item is loading up correctly and looking as expected. If you have to debug, you will have to look through every appearance you made!

**For experienced modders**: This includes you! :)
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
If you would rather have a step-by-step guide for a gendered variant, see [the next section](./#adding-a-male-instance).
{% endhint %} -->

To add an appearance, you will have to touch the following files:

1. \***.yaml**: Adding an entry
2. **appearance.app**: Adding a mapping between rootentity and mesh's appearance
3. **rootentity.ent**: Adding a mapping between yaml's appearance and app's appearance
4. \*_.mesh_:
   1. Adding a MeshMaterialEntry
   2. Adding a MaterialInstance
   3. Adding a material
   4. Connecting those things

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
For a diagram of how everything connects, go [here](archive-xl-item-structure-explained.md#the-final-result).
{% endhint %} -->

### Step 1: Register it in your \*.yaml

1. Duplicate the entire appearance block for an already working item.\
   ⚠Mind the indent!
2. Change the first line to a unique name like `Items.my_custom_shirt_blueblack`
3. Set the new appearance name for the `rootentity.ent`\
   `appearanceName: appearance_root_entity_black_blue`
4.  For lookups in your translation file (`translation_strings.json`): Change the values of `displayName` and `localizedDescription` to the corresponding **secondary keys** in the json file.\
    This is optional.

    ```
      displayName: my_shirt_localization_name_black_blue
      localizedDescription: my_shirt_localization_desc
    ```

    ℹIf you make any mistakes here, the worst that happens is an empty string.
5.  Now, add a new entrie to your .json file:



    ```
    localizationPersistenceOnScreenEntry - []   
    	femaleVariant: my item - now in black and blue
    	maleVariant:  
    	secondaryKey:  my_shirt_localization_name_black_blue
    ```

The total entry should look like this:

```
Items.my_custom_shirt_blueblack:
  $base: Items.GenericInnerChestClothing
  entityName: my_custom_shirt_factory_name
  appearanceName: appearance_root_entity_black_blue
  displayName: my_shirt_localization_name_black_blue
  localizedDescription: my_shirt_localization_desc
  quality: Quality.Legendary
  appearanceSuffixes: []
```

### Step 2: Add it to the rootentity.ent

Expand the list `appearances` and **duplicate** your already working entry.

Change the following fields:\
`appearanceName` => everything before the & must match `appearanceName` in your \*.yaml\
`name` => must match the name you're going to put in your `app.app`

**Example**:

old (copy):

```
	appearanceName: black_red_appearance_name
	name: appearance_root_entity_black_red
```

new:

```
	appearanceName: black_blue_appearance_name
	name: appearance_root_entity_black_blue
```

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to change the `appearanceResource`.
{% endhint %} -->

### Step 3: Add it to my\_custom\_shirt.app

1. Open the .app file and expand the list `appearances`.
2. Duplicate an item and select the new one.
3. Change its name to the one you just defined in the .yaml (`black_blue_appearance_name`)
4. In the new appearance, find the array `partsOverrides` and expand it.
5. Select the item inside.
6. Find and expand the Array `appearanceAppearancePartOverrides` and expand it.
7. Select the first item.
8. Open the array `componentsOverride` and select the first item.
9. Change the value of `meshAppearance` to the name of your new appearance in the mesh:

```
componentName: t1_tutorial_custom_shirt_4711   << no need to change this  
mesh_appearance: mesh_black_blue                << corresponds to meshMeshAppearance.name in my_mesh.mesh  
```

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
You can leave `partsValues` alone - this just points at the file that loads the mesh, and you've already set it up above when setting up the file.
{% endhint %} -->

### Step 4: Add it to the .mesh

This tutorial assumes you already know how to [recolour an item](../editing-existing-items/changing-materials-colors-and-textures.md). Quick reminder about the mlsetup:

1. Export it to json
2. edit the `mlsetup.json` with the [MLSetupBuilder](https://github.com/Neurolinked/MlsetupBuilder)
3. Import it back

Now we're adding the new appearances:

1. Find the array `appearances` and open it.
   1. Duplicate any `meshMeshAppearance`.
   2. Change the name to the one you've defined in the `appearance.app` above (in this case: `mesh_black_blue`):
   3. Select the array `chunkMaterials` and change the entries in the right-hand panel to the name of your new material (e.g. `black_blue`)
2. Find the array `materials` and open it.
   1. Duplicate the last entry. (Yes, use the last one, please, it's important for step 3).
   2. Select the new last entry
   3.  Set the following values:

       ```
       name:  mesh_black_blue           <<< as defined in step 1 and used by meshMeshAppearance in appearances[]  
       index: <index of item in array>  
       ```

       If you duplicated the last material, you can just increase it by one.
3. Find the array `localMaterialBuffer` and open it
   1. Duplicate any entry with an mlsetup (You will see an entry `MultilayerSetup` under `values`)
   2. Drag it to the last position of the array (that's important, because the materials entries match by numeric index)
   3. Select the new item, open `values`, and select `MultilayerSetup`.
   4. Set `baseMaterial/DepotPath` to the `.mlsetup` file that you want.,

### Test it

Now, log into the game and spawn the item variant. The name is in the yaml file, in this case

```
Game.AddToInventory('Items.my_custom_shirt_blueblack')
```

## Adding a Male Instance

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
This part of the tutorial isn't fully up-to-date with the overhauled file structure yet, so keep that in mind when studying the screenshots.
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
Also, this part is super easy to follow and even if you make a mistake, fixing it won't be a problem. But hey, you've put in a lot of work and made great progress, so why not take a sec and back up your project files? Better safe than sorry, right?&#x20;
{% endhint %} -->

Before we proceed with the tutorial, it's important to address a common issue you might have encountered while creating your mod.

If you've tested the mod on a Male V, you might have noticed some weird glitches like mesh clipping or wonky shapes.

You see, we've been using a mesh designed specifically for Female V, and that's why we've been running into some roadblocks. But don't worry, we're here to help you overcome this challenge!

### Preparing the mesh file for the male variant&#x20;

To fix this issue, we'll need a mesh that's compatible with Male V.&#x20;

In the interest of keeping things simple, we've found just the mesh for you! It's called `t1_024_ma_tshirt__sweater.mesh` and it can be found in the `base\characters\garment\citizen_casual\torso\t1_024_tshirt__sweater` directory.

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
If you plan on using other meshes for your mod, ensure that it has `ma` or `pma` in its name.&#x20;

Keep in mind that some `ma` meshes may still have clipping issues when paired with certain types of clothing, while `pma` meshes are specifically designed for V and don't have this problem.&#x20;

If you decide to create your own mesh, be sure to fix any potential issues before using it in your mod. Check out our [<mark style="color:yellow;">3D modeling guide</mark>](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/modding-know-how/3d-modelling) for helpful tips and resources.&#x20;

Remember, a little extra effort in the beginning can save you a lot of headaches down the line!
{% endhint %} -->

Now, add the file to your project, move it to the `tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\` folder and rename it from `t1_024_ma_tshirt__sweater.mesh` to `my_mesh_m.mesh`.&#x20;

Next, follow the steps you used for the original `my_mesh.mesh` by removing any unnecessary entries and adjusting the indices.

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
To avoid any issues, it's crucial to pay close attention to this step and double-check that the correct materials are present in the `localMaterialBuffer` and `materialEntries`, and that the indices are adjusted correctly.&#x20;

This will ensure that your mod works as intended without any glitches or errors. If you need a refresher, [<mark style="color:yellow;">click here</mark>](./#optional-but-very-recommended-clean-out-obsolete-entries) to return to that section.
{% endhint %} -->

### Creating a .ent File for Your Custom Mesh

It's time to set up the .ent file for our mesh. Don't worry, it's easy!&#x20;

Start by making a copy of the `mesh_entity.ent` file that you previously created for the female version by duplicating it, and rename it to `mesh_entity_m.ent`.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/meshentitypreview.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>duplicating <strong>mesh_entity.ent</strong> and creating the new <strong>mesh_entity_m.ent</strong> for out new mesh</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Inside the `mesh_entity_m.ent` file, find the first component of the type `entGarmentSkinnedMeshComponent`. Set the following values:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
mesh:   DepotPath:   tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\my_mesh_m.mesh      << path to your mesh  
        Flags:       Default                               << leave this alone  
name:   my_shirt_m    << this corresponds to the appearanceOverride in appearance.app  
```
{% endcode %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/meshentity.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>All of the changes made to <strong>mesh_entity_m.ent</strong> file</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Edit the yourModName.yaml

Inside the `yourModName.yaml` file set the `appearanceSuffixes` array to `itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Gender`

```
Items.my_custom_shirt_redwhite:
  $base: Items.GenericInnerChestClothing
  entityName: my_custom_shirt_factory_name
  appearanceName: appearance_root_entity_white_red
  displayName: my_shirt_localization_name_white_red
  localizedDescription: my_shirt_localization_desc
  quality: Quality.Legendary
  appearanceSuffixes: [ itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Gender ]
  icon:
    atlasResourcePath: tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\ops\preview_icons.inkatlas
    atlasPartName: slot_01
```

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
If you are unclear about why this step was taken, we recommend [reading up on suffixes](../../../modding-know-how/files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/.ent-files-suffixes.md)!
{% endhint %} -->

### Edit the rootentity.ent

1. Find the array `appearances`.
2. Expand the first entry.
   1. Append _\&Female_ to the name attribute. This will change the name from `appearance_root_entity_white_red` to `appearance_root_entity_white_red&Female`.
3. Duplicate the first (and only) entry to create a new one.
4. Expand the newly create entry
   1. Set `name : appearance_root_entity_white_red&Male`.
   2. Set `appearanceName : my_shirt_m`.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/rootentity.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>All of the changes made to <strong>rootentity.ent</strong> file</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Edit the appearance.app

1. Find the array `appearances`
2. Duplicate the first entry to create a new one and expand it
3. Set the `name` attribute to `my_shirt_m` (as defined in the root\_entity)
4. Find the array `partsValues`
   1. Set the resource path to your new male mesh entity file:\
      `resource : tutorial\myshirt\mesh_entity_m.ent`
5. Find the array `partsOverrides`
   1. Find the array componentOverrides
      1. Set `componentName : my_shirt_m`
   2. Set `partResources : tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\mesh_entity_m.ent`

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/appearance.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>All of the changes made to <strong>appearance.app</strong> file. Paths are not up-to-date!</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Testing the mod

To test your mod, it's important to ensure that it works correctly for both male and female V. This means you'll need to have two separate save files, one for male V and one for female V, unless you're using a mod that allows you to quickly switch between them.

Test your mod independently for both cases by loading the appropriate save file and checking that the mod is working as intended. To spawn and equip your item, use the command specified in your YAML file.

```
Game.AddToInventory("Items.my_custom_shirt_redwhite")
```

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
Consider reviewing the guide to ensure that all steps have been followed correctly and that the values have been set appropriately. Ensure that the mesh is compatible with the male variant of V. If errors persist, review the [<mark style="color:yellow;">troubleshooting section</mark>](./#troubleshooting) for further assistance.
{% endhint %} -->

## Troubleshooting

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
There is a tool designed to help you with the process of finding missing dependencies. You can find it [here](https://github.com/solaarTW/DeepAssetDiscovery/releases).
{% endhint %} -->

First of all, check the logs for errors including the name of your mod:&#x20;

* `red4ext/plugins/ArchiveXL/ArchiveXL.log`&#x20;
* `red4ext/plugins/TweakXL/TweakXL.log`

Second of all, make sure that you do not have capital letters in any of your path or file names - as of 1-1-6, they are not currently supported.

### My item warps weirdly

... deforms incorrectly, or is a puddle on the floor?

Most likely, you have ignored the [hint box](./#get-the-files-create-the-structure) when picking your `mesh_entity.ent:` Make sure that you're using an entity file that corresponds with the slot that you are trying to replace (e.g. if your item is a pair of shoes, you need an entity file from `base\characters\garment\player_equipment\feet`).

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
**If you are here because of a link from a different guide:**&#x20;

You can find out which entity file your item uses by right-clicking on your mesh and selecting "find files using this". Add the .ent file to the list and open it in WolvenKit. Then, [replace the contents](../../npcs/appearances-change-the-looks.md#safely-adding-components) of the "components" array with those of an .ent file from the correct folder — don't forget to change the path to your mesh again!
{% endhint %} -->

### I spawn my item, but nothing happens!

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
Before you start digging into your file structure, check if there are any leftover yml files from earlier versions/deploys in your tweaks directory. Do a full text search in e.g. Notepad++ in any files in the folder with the name of the item you want to spawn.
{% endhint %} -->

If no additional yml files are messing things up, then the error is somewhere in the first part of the chain and relatively easy to fix:

<figure><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f8ee9b6e640405d93e9d543b4ac488e7644a5976c74552a54d288ac9b81f182a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f517a4d6e7645762e706e67" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check the following places:

* `yourmodname.archive.xl`:
  * Is the indentation correct, as shown in the picture?
  * Does the value for `entityName` have a corresponding entry in the factory (my\_tshirt\_factory`.csv`)?
  * Does it point at the correct rootentity(`tutorial\myshirt\rootentity.ent`), or did you rename or move it?
  * Did you make any typos?
* `rootentity.ent:`
  * Is the spelling for the key you defined after `displayName` and `localizedDescription` identical to the one in the json file?
  * Are you using any **suffixes**? Are you using the correct ones? Try creating a fall-back entry without any suffixes.

### My item shows empty text instead of name/description!

Something went wrong with your json file:

<figure><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6aebdc1d9a291c0bc2fbfc0b56006f87c3db452343ef4e938cfe33ca3bfa3768/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f583562703644372e706e67" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If there are no errors in any of the log files, check the following places:

* `yourmodname.archive.xl`:
  * Does the key `localization - onscreens - en-us` exist?
  * Is the indentation correct, as shown in the picture?
  * Does it point at the correct file (`tutorial\ops\translation_strings.json`), or did you rename or move it?
  * Did you make any typos?
* `yourModName.yaml:`
  * Is the spelling for the key you defined after `displayName` and `localizedDescription` identical to the one in the json file?
* `translation_strings.json`:
  * Is the spelling of the key defined in yaml's `displayName` and `localizedDescription` identical?
  * Did you set the femaleVariant (default)?
  * Are you using quotation marks? If so, switch to singlequotes!



### The item spawns, but…

Congratulations, you've made it into the right half of the diagram! The error will be somewhere here:

<figure><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/621b7d370bdaaec42cf16a5a321512eaf0eaeb0decbe6ccc23865023802f98e7/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f666c34306f465a2e706e67" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
If you set your `mesh_entity.ent` to point at a vanilla mesh, you can rule out your custom mesh and .mlsetup as a source of errors. Original game meshes will always have a working default appearance and will thus always be displayed!
{% endhint %} -->

### The game crashes!

That means the chain is working, but something isn't loaded correctly. That's good! Check the following files:

* `appearance.app`: Check the `partsValues` and `partsOverrides` entries. They need to point at the `mesh_entity.ent`, **not** at the mesh.
* `mesh_entity.ent`: Does the `component` entry point to a valid mesh? Try it with a default mesh as detailed above.

If that works, then the problem is your mesh.

### Troubleshooting a mesh

For more detailed error handling, check the sections below.

ℹ In the "Mesh Preview" tab of your mesh, you can "Generate Materials for Appearance". If the correct colours show up, you can at least rule out that the error is in the .\*mesh or the \*.mlsetup!

* Make sure that you have the same number of entries in `materialEntries` and `localMaterialBuffer.materials` .
* Go through the `CMaterialInstance`s in `localMaterialBuffer.materials`.
  * Make sure that the files you're loading exist.
  * Make sure that you don't load a mlmask under a key for an mlsetup or vice versa.

If none of that helps, I suggest

* doing a gdb export
* throwing away your mesh (don't close the WKit tab yet), falling back to the original one
* doing a gdb import
* replacing the arrays `appearances`, `localMaterialBuffer.materials` and `materialEntries` with those from your previous mesh.

### My mesh is black and shiny!

Congratulations, this is about the easiest-to-resolve error that you could've had. Your mesh is loaded correctly, there is only a problem with the rendered **material**.

Check your mesh file:

* Check the connection between `appearance`, `materialEntry` and `localMaterial.CMaterialInstance`. Are the names correct?
* Go through the `CMaterialInstance`s in `localMaterialBuffer.materials`.
  * Make sure that the files you're loading exist.
  * Make sure that you don't load a mlmask under a key for an mlsetup or vice versa.

### My mesh has the wrong appearance!

Either an appearance is incorrectly selected, or it is incorrectly resolved. Check the following places for copy-paste/duplication mistakes:

**yourModName.yaml** - is the `appearanceName` correct, or did you forget to change it?\
**rootentity.ent** - does the `name` corresponding to the field above point to the `appearanceName` with the right name?\
**appearance.app** - does the appearance's `partOverride` set the correct appearance in the `componentsOverride`?

Now, check the mesh file (close and re-open it to make everything refresh):

**appearance** - does it use the correctly named material?\
**materialEntries** - is the index correct, or is it pointing at the index of the actually displayed material?\
**localMaterialBuffer** - does the CMaterialInstance use the correct .mlsetup file?

Finally, check the .mlsetup: does it actually use different colours, or is it just a duplicate?

### My mesh is invisible!

Here we go. This is the big one, and it's Not Fun. The error can be anywhere between the yaml and the mesh. You can rule out one of the files with the following question:

**Does the glitching stop after <10 seconds?**\
If not: the appearance can't be resolved - ignore the mesh\
If yes: the appearance is resolved, but can't be displayed - ignore the yaml

ℹIf the appearance is resolved, but not displayed (short glitch), the first thing you should do is to change the path in the `mesh_entity.ent` to one of the game's default meshes. This will rule out errors on your part. (_Yes, even if your mesh worked in another mod. No, I'm not speaking from experience, why do you ask?_)

If the hint above doesn't solve it, proceed to troubleshoot in the same way as "My mesh has the wrong appearance!" above.

### My garment tucks into/under other garments incorrectly

That's due to [garment support](../../../modding-know-how/3d-modelling/garment-support-how-does-it-work.md) - check the link to learn more.

### I can't find anything, kill me now

Time to restore your files one by one to the last working backup and restart from there.\
Don't delete them, keep them in a different folder - you will be able to copy a lot of stuff over.

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
By right-clicking on a tab title, you can move it to a new document group for easier copying.
{% endhint %} -->

\
Good luck, soldier.
