# Items: Equipment

Welcome to the modding equipment section. Here, you can find guides on how to edit equipment and wepaons in Cyberpunk. The section is split into three sub-pages:

{% content-ref url="adding-new-items/" %}
[adding-new-items](adding-new-items/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="editing-existing-items/" %}
[editing-existing-items](editing-existing-items/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="influencing-other-items.md" %}
[influencing-other-items.md](influencing-other-items.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Wait, that's not what I want!

You can check the "**Modding: Know-How**" section in the left sidebar for more general knowledge, such as:

* If you want to find out an item's base ID / console spawn code, check [here](../../modding-know-how/references-lists-and-overviews/equipment/spawn-codes-baseids-hashes.md).&#x20;
* If you want to learn about variants and appearances, check [here](../../modding-know-how/references-lists-and-overviews/equipment/variants-and-appearances.md).&#x20;
* If you're editing **meshes**, maybe the [3d modelling section](../../modding-know-how/3d-modelling/) will help you
  * If you're struggling with import/export, check [the guide](../../modding-know-how/3d-modelling/exporting-and-importing-meshes/)
* If you're editing **textures**, check the [texture section](../../modding-know-how/textures/)
