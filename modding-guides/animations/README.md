# Animations

## Summary

This page and its subpages contain links to guides about making animations and poses (static animations) for Cyberpunk 2077 and importing them into the game. For theoretical information, please refer to the [Animations part of the knowledge base](../../modding-know-how/animations.md).

For individual guides, please check the sub-pages on the left!


Please see xbaebsae (Angy)'s [animation guide](https://xbaebsae.jimdofree.com/cyberpunk-2077-tutorials/cp2077-custom-poses-and-animations/) for a starting point. Note that you can't do this for first person animations!
