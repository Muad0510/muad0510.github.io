# Assets

## What is an asset?

An asset is a specific, objectified concept in the game that can be highly detailed like a blade of grass, or larger like a building, or intangible like sound effects. Unity defines an asset as, "Shorthand for anything that goes into a video game â€“ characters, objects, sound effects, maps, environments, etc." Every asset is defined in a set of [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database\_normalization) asset files that describe its relationship to the game, other assets, and itself.

## Visual Asset-Related File Formats

The following list contains file formats that are used to compose visual assets such as vehicles and weapons.


The community-devloped tool **WolvenKit** can be used to browse game archives and extract game files.\
