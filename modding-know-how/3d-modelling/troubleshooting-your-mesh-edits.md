# Troubleshooting your mesh edits

## Importing

### Tangents

You get an error message like this:

`Message: One or more Geometry in provided GLTF doesn't contain Tangents data. Tangents must be included within glTF files.`

1. Check if your mesh is **triangulated**. If you aren't sure whether or not it is, go into edit mode, select everything, and go to Face -> Triangulate (Shortcut: Ctrl+T)
2. If that doesn't change anything, make sure that you have the correct box checked upon export:\
   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/3d\_troubleshooting\_export\_tangents.png)
3. If that's not the issue either, check that each of your submeshes has an UV map: \
   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/mesh\_troubleshooting\_uv\_map.png)\
   If not, you have to create one (and probably UV unwrap your mesh).

### Bone: neutral\_bone not present in export Rig(s)/Import Mesh

The neutral bone is created by the glb export plugin when there are vertex groups without a parent bone. WolvenKit will not let you import if there is a mismatch.

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
Your armature in Blender needs to have a bone for every vertex group in the submesh, and there must not be vertices with no vertex group assigned.&#x20;

You then need to import over an [already-existing .mesh file](troubleshooting-your-mesh-edits.md#option-2-the-netrunner-suit) which supports all those bones.
{% endhint %} -->

The following two scripts help you finding and/or fixing the problem. Switch to the Blender Scripting perspective and create a new, blank text file. Then, toggle the Blender system console to see their output (Blender: Window -> Toggle System Console)

**Missing bones**

To find which bones you're missing, you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/manavortex/080d04065ee4c45aaad1e7c221db68c9), which will print their names to console.&#x20;

**Vertices without weights**

You can use [this Python script](https://github.com/manavortex/code\_snippets/blob/master/py/blender/delete\_vertices\_without\_group.py) to either select or auto-delete vertices with no weight.

#### Option 1: Fuck those bones

You can [import the mesh with Noesis](exporting-and-importing-meshes/#noesis-.fbx-2), which will not do any of these checks. For that, you need to import/export via .fbx.

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
Since noesis expects differently-named submeshes under the root armature, you'll want to export the mesh via noesis, join your changed meshes on those under Noesis\_Root, and import it again.\
**Caution:** You'll have to rotate your armature in this case.
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="danger" %}
While this will get your mesh into the game, the missing bones mean that parts of it won't move the way you expect it!
{% endhint %} -->

#### Option 2: The Netrunner suit

The armature from the following mesh has a lot of bones and will often resolve most of your issues:

```
t0_005_pwa_body__t_bug.mesh
t0_005_pma_body__t_bug.mesh
```

Try using the Netrunner body as a base for import. To have more than one submesh, you can simply duplicate the existing one and adjust the naming, e.g. `submesh_01_LOD_1`, `submesh_02_LOD_1`

#### Option 3: Transferring bones

It's time to play 3d puzzle and assemble bones from multiple sources. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for this yet. You need to&#x20;

* find the bones that your armature is missing in other meshes
* [transfer them ](https://xbaebsae.jimdofree.com/tutorials/cp2077-transferring-and-expanding-skeletons-in-meshes/)into your import target mesh
* export all the extra meshes into Blender&#x20;
* [merge their rigs](https://github.com/Simarilius-uk/CP2077\_BlenderScripts/blob/main/Merge\_rigs.py), which you should do with the linked Python script
* and finally reimport everything back into Cyberpunk.

### Everything else

WolvenKit will not import a mesh that has any kind of issues. Those include, but are not limited to:&#x20;

* non-flat faces
* zero faces/edges
* loose vertices/edges

**There is no guarantee that any of the steps below will actually solve your problem.**&#x20;

#### **Edit Mode**

In Edit Mode, you can find a few commands in the Mesh -> Clean Up menu:

* Delete Loose
* Split Non-Planar Faces
* Split Concave Faces
* Merge By Distance\


<!-- {% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;If you select your whole mesh, **Merge By Distance** will merge the individual parts, obliterating the seams. To avoid that, make sure to do them one after another:\
\- Select a vertex/edge/face in Edit Mode\
\- hold down Ctrl Num+ to select everything connected\
\- use Merge By Distance before proceeding to the next part of your mesh
{% endhint %} -->

#### It's still broken

Your last option is the [3d print tool](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/3d\_print\_toolbox.html) to (hopefully) find out what is wrong with your mesh.&#x20;

Fortunately, the tool is free, easy-to-use and already included in your Blender.

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a 3d print entry in the tools of your 3d viewport, you might need to enable the plugin in Blender's settings first.
{% endhint %} -->

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/blender 3d print tool.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the 3d print tool in edit mode to directly fix your issues</p></figcaption></figure>

* Zero Edges: Those are bad, fix them (click on them, then press X and just delete them)
* Non-Flat Faces: Those are even worse, as they can make the game crash. You need to split them up until they are flat, or investigate the surrounding edges/vertices to see what's going wrong here.
* Zero Faces: Only fix if you have <100 of them — the tool doesn't always identify them correctly (the mesh analyzed above was `h0_000_pwa_c__basehead`, which is absolutely fine).&#x20;



## In-Game

### My mesh won't show up

#### In Blender

* make sure that you have exactly one UV map
* check **Face Orientation** — most materials won't show backfaces (red). You can import submeshes with the suffix `_doubled` to make WolvenKit generate them for you, like it does with hair.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/mesh_troubleshooting_checks.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### In Wolvenkit

When saving your mesh, check the console for errors. In version >= 8.9.0, a basic material validation is taking place. \
If you don't see any warnings, make sure that the resource paths in your mesh are correct and that you aren't loading invisible textures.

### My mesh won't move at all

Some meshes require an entAnimatedComponent along with the garment's component. Check [here](../../modding-guides/npcs/appearances-change-the-looks.md#animations-if-you-cant-avoid-them-copy-them-as-well) for details.

### Changes from Blender are missing in-game

For example, you have moved something, but the change doesn't show in the game: this most often happens when you change things around in edit mode, since they are stored as object properties rather than applied immediately.

1. Select the object in edit mode
2. Press Ctrl+A
3. Select "All Transforms" to apply all transformations.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/mesh\_troubleshooting\_apply\_transforms.png)

### My mesh is moving weirdly

E.g. you've changed a shape, but now everything moves at an offset.&#x20;

As stated in the [importing/exporting guide](exporting-and-importing-meshes/), it is easy to fuck up the mesh's properties, and this is most likely what happened. The easiest way to "fix" this is to apply your shape deformation to the original object.

#### Replacing the vertices

1. Import the original object into Blender, without any of your changes. If you have to, reexport the working file from Wolvenkit.\
   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/mesh\_troubleshooting\_reimport.png)
2. In Object Mode, select all meshes under the reimported armature (the original ones).
3. Switch to Edit Mode and select all vertices (Ctrl+A)
4. Delete them (x, vertices, Return)
5. Go back to Object mode
6. For each of your edited objects:&#x20;
   1. select the submesh that you edited (submesh\_00\_LOD\_1)
   2. select the empty submesh from the reimported armature (submesh\_00\_LOD\_1.001)
   3. Join the objects (Ctrl+J). This will fuse your edited mesh into the empty one, retaining all of the original's properties.
7. You can now delete the empty armature and export the other one for re-import.

### My mesh is completely warped

If you have [added the item](../../modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items/) via [ArchiveXL](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl) or [swapped out an in-game item](../../modding-guides/items-equipment/editing-existing-items/replace-a-player-item-with-an-npc-item.md) with something that belongs in a different slot (e.g. a jacket on the head slot), you might have to fix the corresponding entity file.

### My mesh is string cheese/exploding vertices/a puddle on the floor

#### GarmentSupports

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
To check if it's this, equip **only** the edited item. If it breaks as soon as you put on another clothing item with [garment supports](garment-support-how-does-it-work.md#the-algorithm), then the solution below applies.
{% endhint %} -->

Delete GarmentSupport from the mesh:
