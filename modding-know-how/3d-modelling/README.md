### Mesh

A mesh defines the shape and surface of any in-game object.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on .mesh files and how they work, see [here](../files-and-what-they-do/3d-objects-.mesh-files.md).

For more informations on **materials** and mesh appearances, see [here](../materials/).
{% endhint %}

### Morphtarget

Morphtargets are a special kind of mesh used for alternate and additional shapes beyond the static shape a `.mesh` can define. If your source is a `.morphtarget`, you need to primarily work with that rather than the `.mesh`.&#x20;
