# Autodesk/FBX (Noesis)


Noesis is an **alternative** to exporting with WolvenKit. There are legitimate use cases for why you would want this. If you don't know them, **you probably don't.**


### TL;DR:&#x20;

Noesis is outdated. Go import/export [with Wolvenkit](./).

### Explanation

5000 years ago on the slopes of Mount Doom, mods were created with nothing but pickaxes, home-spun hemp, and hex editing. Older guides will refer to Noesis as **the way to go** — but Wolvenkit has come a long way since then. The import/export is reliable and works, and unless you [run into issues](../troubleshooting-your-mesh-edits.md), you will probably want to [stick to it](./).

Given that you're still reading this, you probably have a reason to use Noesis, so here we go.


To use Noesis, you need the [Noesis Import/Export Plugin](https://github.com/alphazolam/fmt\_CP77mesh?msclkid=384152bfaa5611ecbad0234dbe6a5c45).

## Exporting from the Wolvenkit project

1. Navigate the Noesis browser to your file on the disk (you can right-click on the mesh in Wolvenkit and select "`Open in File Explorer`")
2. Right-click it in the Noesis Browser and select "Export"
3. Export with default settings:

Done. You can now import the fbx to Blender.

### Blender: Saving for import

Simply export as fbx, Blender's standard settings are fine for Noesis.

## Importing

Noesis is an **alternative** to importing with WolvenKit.

* Find your fbx in the Noesis browser
* Right-click it and select "Export"
* Set the `Main output type` to `.mesh - CyberPunk 2077 mesh [PC]`
* A dialogue asks you for a file to overwrite. Make sure that it has your mesh!

## Differences between fbx and glb

There are a few differences between Noesis and WolvenKit when it comes to exporting your meshes:

|               | Autodesk (fbx) | glTF Binary (glb)   |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Armature      | Rotation W: 0  | Rotation W: 1       |
|               | Rotation Z: -1 | Rotation Z: 0       |
| Submesh names | submesh0       | submesh\_00\_LOD\_1 |

You can easily convert between the two formats by hand — or use [this script](https://github.com/manavortex/code\_snippets/blob/master/py/blender/convert\_gltf\_fbx.py): Switch to Blender's Scripting perspective, create a new file, paste the contents in, and run it.
