# .ent files: Suffixes

## Summary

This page explains how to&#x20;

If you already know the theory and just want to pick the right combination, check "[which suffixes exist](.ent-files-suffixes.md#which-suffixes-exist)" below.

## What are suffixes?

In a [root\_entity file](./#root-entity), you can give the game a list of appearances and have them mapped to an [.app file](../../../developers/vehicles/archive/.app-file-appearanceresource.md) by entry name. While that's pretty good already, have you ever wanted to be more specific — for example, "for a male character, use this appearance, but for a female use this other one?"

This is where suffixes come in. You append them to an appearance's name in the [root\_entity](./#root-entity), and the game will pick the correct appearance (and the correct [app file](../../../developers/vehicles/archive/.app-file-appearanceresource.md), and the correct [mesh](broken-reference)!) based on the best match.



If you are registering an item via ArchiveXL, you can define suffixes via  `appearanceSuffixes: [ … ]` in the .yaml file.


Your item will inherit the suffix setup from the `$base` component. In the example of `Items.GenericHeadClothing`, that will be

```
appearanceSuffixes: [ 
  itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Gender, 
  itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Camera ]  
```


### What can possibly go wrong?


**These bad beans can be the reason why your item is invisible!**! You can and should disable the suffixes if you don't need them.

To do so, add an empty array to the yaml entry:

```
appearanceSuffixes: []
```


## Which suffixes exist?


For a full list, see For a more in-depth list, check (TODO: Psi's github?)


For clothing items, the following suffixes are relevant:

<table><thead><tr><th width="421">Suffix</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Gender</code></td><td>This item is gendered<br>When resolving the appearance name via <code>rootentity.ent</code>, the game will look for <code>appearanceName&#x26;Female</code> and <code>appearanceName&#x26;Male</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Camera</code></td><td>This item has special rules for first and third person camera<br>When resolving the appearance name via <code>rootentity.ent</code>, the game will look for <code>appearanceName&#x26;FPP</code> and <code>appearanceName&#x26;TPP</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Partial</code></td><td>If the current item has <code>hide_T1part</code> part and slot <code>OuterChest</code> is not hidden, will search <code>rootentity.ent</code> for<code>&#x26;Full</code> or <code>&#x26;Part</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.HairType</code></td><td>Defines how your item will look if a certain hair type is loaded (e.g., hide the back half of a bandana for long hair).<br>When resolving the appearance name via <code>rootentity.ent</code>, the game will look for <code>&#x26;Short</code>, <code>&#x26;Long</code>, <code>&#x26;Dreads</code>, <code>&#x26;Buzz</code>, <code>&#x26;Bald</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



### Suffix load order

1. the base appearance (with no suffix)
2. the most specific suffix collection it can find

#### Example:&#x20;

V has a female body gender and you're in photo mode (third person camera). Your base appearance is called `appearance_`.

| full appearance name                                                                                                                    |                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appearance_`                                                                                                                           | Found first, then ignored because a more specific appearance exists. |
| <p><code>appearance_&#x26;Male</code><br><code>appearance_&#x26;Male&#x26;FPP</code><br><code>appearance_&#x26;Male&#x26;TPP</code></p> | Ignored: V's body gender isn't male                                  |
| `appearance_&Female`                                                                                                                    | ignored: a better match exists                                       |
| `appearance_&Female&FPP`                                                                                                                | ignored: you are not in first person camera                          |
| `appearance_&Female&TPP`                                                                                                                | best match! The game will use this one!                              |
