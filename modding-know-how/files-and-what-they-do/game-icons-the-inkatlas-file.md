# Game icons: The inkatlas file


Apart has prepared a reference project with an import-ready inkatlas. You can download it [here](https://mega.nz/file/vUUDEQxS#w66XKJ7acIsnXuJcOBEwPPDcm4GFtSa06MzZccAaX8Y).


## Summary

The .inkatlas is a map file that slices [**textures**](../textures/) into slots, which are then used by the game for pretty much everything that is a picture - from your HUD to peoples' phone avatars to item preview icons in shops or custom atelier images.&#x20;
