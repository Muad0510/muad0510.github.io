# Components



<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
[Comprehensive Components List](comprehensive-components-list.md) organized by hierarchy. Use for researching and documenting components.
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
In general, your components should have a **globally unique name** so you can target them via [partsOverrides](../../../modding-guides/items-equipment/influencing-other-items.md#partsoverrides). Feel free to ignore this, almost everyone else does as well, but it is the reason behind the convoluted names of CDPR's components.
{% endhint %} -->

## Equipment/Hair

### entGarmentSkinnedMeshComponent

Can be used interchangeably with `entSkinnedMeshComponent`.

* Loads a mesh from a [depotPath](./#depotpath).&#x20;
* Supports [chunkMask](./#chunkmask).
* meshAppearance will select an appearance by name from the mesh's defined [appearances](broken-reference).
* Lets you enable and disable **shadows** with the properties `castShadows` and `castLocalShadows`

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
This is the good kind of mesh component, the one that will work without trouble, as opposed to [entSkinnedClothComponent](./#entskinnedclothcomponent).
{% endhint %} -->

### entSkinnedMeshComponent

\=> [entGarmentSkinnedMeshComponent](./#entgarmentskinnedmeshcomponent)

### entSkinnedClothComponent

Like [ent(Garment)SkinnedMeshComponent](./#entskinnedmeshcomponent), but with a `physicalMesh` and physics. Usually comes together with an [entAnimatedComponent](./#entanimatedcomponent) (they're usually named `collar` for clothes and `dangle` for hair and accessories).

### entAnimatedComponent

Adds physics to garments and hair meshes.

## NPCs

### gameDismembermentComponent

Defines dismemberment rules for NPCs. (TBD: ???)

## Generic

### gameInteractionComponent

Adds interaction prompt to entity. (Shouldn't work without gameTargetingComponent, but this hasn't been double-checked.)

### entColliderComponent

### gameTargetingComponent

Allows targeting via CET.&#x20;

### gameScanningComponent

## Properties

A list of component properties with explanations.

#### chunkMask

Only used for [meshes](broken-reference): Determines which parts of a mesh will be displayed or hidden. Numeric indices correspond with the submeshes by index.

#### depotPath

Relative path to a resource within the game files. Used to load dependencies â€” meshes, rigs, animations, effects.
