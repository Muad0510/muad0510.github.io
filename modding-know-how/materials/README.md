# ðŸ”® Materials

This is the landing page for **materials** in Cyberpunk 2077. It contains a definition and a rough overview.&#x20;

## If you already know that:

* To find material instances or -templates for direct edits, check [here](../references-lists-and-overviews/cheat-sheet-materials.md).
* For a mesh-specific explanation, check [here](broken-reference).&#x20;
* For a list of properties and their explanation check [here](configuring-materials.md).

## Definition&#x20;

**In the context of Cyberpunk**, a material is the thing that lets the shader define the surface properties of a [mesh](broken-reference).&#x20;

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
Each part of a mesh (submesh) can have a different material assigned.&#x20;

[Do you want  to know more?](broken-reference)
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
Materials can be defined [locally inside a mesh](broken-reference) or [loaded externally](broken-reference) from [material template files](re-using-materials-.mi.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
For a hands-on guide and something to play around/experiment with, check [here](../../modding-guides/everything-else/textured-items-and-cyberpunk-materials.md).
{% endhint %} -->

## What kinds of material exist?

### Textured

If you have modded other games, you're used to PBR materials with a bunch of textures like **diffuse**, **normal,** **metalness** etc.&#x20;

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
To start with a textured material, see [here](configuring-materials.md#textured-material).
{% endhint %} -->

<!-- {% hint style="info" %}
Did you know? You can make Cyberpunk's default textured material glow.
{% endhint %} -->

### Multilayered

This is specific to Cyberpunk, and it is incredibly cool. If you're used to textured materials, you're probably going to hate it at first, but it has incredible versatility and re-usability.&#x20;

<!-- {% hint style="success" %}
To start with a multilayered material, see [here](configuring-materials.md#multilayered-material). To read up on how it works, see [here](./#multilayered).
{% endhint %} -->
