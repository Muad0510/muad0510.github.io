# Materials: troubleshooting

## My material ignores transparency!

If you have [done everything correctly](../textures/images-importing-editing-exporting.md), then something in the mesh got borked. Easiest way to fix:&#x20;

* Export your mesh
* Re-name it to act as a backup
* Replace it with something where transparency definitely works
* Import over that mesh
* Copy-paste the material setup from the original mesh
