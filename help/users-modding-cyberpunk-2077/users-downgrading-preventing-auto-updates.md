# Users: Downgrading / Preventing auto-updates

{% hint style="info" %}
Things fall down when you let go of them, and mods break whenever a game updates. That is due to [framework compatibility](../../modding-know-how/core-mods-explained/).&#x20;

**Always make sure that your framework mods are up-to-date.**

You should generally wait with updating to the latest game version until all mods are up-to-date. If it's too late for that, you can try [downgrading](users-downgrading-preventing-auto-updates.md#downgrading) Cyberpunk, or wait until the frameworks update.

## Preventing the game from auto-updating

### GOG

In GOG, this is a global setting — you can only disable auto-update for all of your games.

Open the settings and select the entry `Game features` in the sidebar, then uncheck the box for `Auto-update games`.

### Epic

In the EPIC launcher, this is a global setting — you can only disable auto-update for all of your games.&#x20;

Open the settings menu and scroll down to `MANAGE GAMES`, then disable auto-updates.

### Steam

Unlike the competition, Steam will not give you any control about auto-updating. For that reason, you need to forbid it from writing to a specific file on disk, without which it will be literally unable to update. Here's how:

1. Find the `steamapps` folder (:&#x20;
   1. Right-click on Cyberpunk 2077 in your Steam Library and select **`Properties`**
   2. On the side bar, click on **`Local Files`**
   3. Select **`Browse`**. This will take you to Cyberpunk's install directory, which is **inside** the folder we want (e.g. `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077`)
   4. Navigate two levels up
2. Find the file `appmanifest_1091500.acf`
3. Set the file to read-only:
   1. Right-click on the file and select Properties
   2. At the bottom of the dialogue, check the Read-only box

&#x20;![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png>)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As long as Steam can't write to this file, it can't update Cyberpunk. Once you are ready to update, simply uncheck the Read-only checkbox again.

Don't forget to deactivate it again later!
{% endhint %}

## Downgrading

### Epic

Sorry, choomba, you're fucked. No downgrading possible.

### Steam

Steam doesn't directly support downgrading, but you can use steamdb to attempt to download a previous depot. Longer instructions can be found [in this MakeUseOf guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-steam-games/), but the condensed version (courtesy of our lovely Discord community) goes as follows:\
\
First [turn autoupdate off for Steam](users-downgrading-preventing-auto-updates.md#preventing-the-game-from-auto-updating) _**now**_ so that you don't forget to do it later. We'll wait.\
\
The depot for the **current version 1.62-hotfix (3.0.71)** is `download_depot 1091500 1091501 6912231438248154766` (this is **version specific**. Please reach out to update the version if it's outdated.)

1. Open Steam
2. Press `Win+R`
3. Type `steam://open/console` to get into the steamdb console
4. In the console, enter this command exactly to start the download (it'll be the entire 60 GB so be prepared): `download_depot 1091500 1091501 6912231438248154766`&#x20;
5. After the game finishes downloading, go to the installation location listed in the console, and copy either just the changed files (you can view the manifest for the new version) or the whole thing over your game directory to overwrite the new changes.

This should leave you with the correct previous game version. You can right-click cyberpunk2077.exe to verify the versions in Properties > Details.

You might still need to do a script cache reset or other cleanup before the game starts up nice, so head on over to [those instructions](../../modding-know-how/user-guide-troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-after-an-update) if need be.
