# ❔ Users: Modding Cyberpunk 2077

{% hint style="info" %}
This page contains instructions on **installing** mods. If you want to **create** mods instead, check [here](../../modding-know-how/modding-cyberpunk-2077/).
{% endhint %}

## How to install mods

{% hint style="danger" %}
**TL;DR:**&#x20;

_The first thing you will be told on Discord is to read this guide._

When installing a mod, make sure to install _all_ of its dependencies. You will find a list on the Nexus description tab under "Requirements".

If you do not do this, your mod will not work.

You need to [enable REDmod](./#installing-and-activating-redmod). Without it, most of your mods will not work.
{% endhint %}

You mod **Cyberpunk 2077** by adding files to your **game directory**. There is no need to overwrite base game files, since the game natively supports modding.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The **game directory** is the toplevel folder of your game install.&#x20;

Unless you changed the default settings, it will be installed to:

**STEAM**\
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\`

**GOG**\
`C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Cyberpunk 2077\`
{% endhint %}

You can install mods by hand or by using [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Regardless of your past experiences, the [Nexus mod manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) works reliably and well for modding Cyberpunk, as long as you do not install more than \~250 REDmods.
{% endhint %}

### Dependencies / Requiremends

Although Cyberpunk natively supports modding, this out-of-the-box support is extremely limited. To allow modders greater freedom, a number of frameworks have been created to allow e.g. adding items, influencing the weather, or add flying cars.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since this kind of mod interacts with the game's code on such a fundamental level, they are prone to **breaking** whenever CDPR changes their API. This is the reason why game updates break mods — we recommend to [**turn off auto-update**](users-downgrading-preventing-auto-updates.md) and manually upgrading once the frameworks you need have been brought up-to-date.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Unless they are marked as optional, you **have** to install the dependencies, and their dependencies as well.&#x20;

If you don't, then your mod will not work.
{% endhint %}

### Overview of mod folders

{% hint style="info" %}
TL;DR: you can ignore this.
{% endhint %}

This list is supposed to give you an overview of which files go where. It is **not** a bucket list of things you have to install.

| Folder path in your game dir | Description of folder                                                                                                                             |

## Installing and activating REDmod

If REDmod is not installed and activated, your mods will not load.&#x20;

* For instructions on how to install, see [here](../../modding-know-how/frameworks/redmod/#installation).
* For instructions on how to activate it, see [here for GOG](../../modding-know-how/core-mods-explained/redmod/usage.md#gog-galaxy) and here for [Steam and Epic](../../modding-know-how/core-mods-explained/redmod/usage.md#steam-and-epic).

REDmods are installed in `Cyberpunk 2077\mods`, where every mod has a subfolder with an `info.json`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on your other mods, you might require [cybercmd](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5176).
{% endhint %}

## Installing Mods

You can install mods via [Vortex](./#vortex) or [manually](./#manual-install). There are upsides and downsides to each — however, **for beginners, we recommend using Vortex**.

### Vortex

#### What does Vortex do and should I use it?

{% hint style="success" %}
If you had terrible experiences with Vortex for other games, be assured: Cyberpunk integration is working extremely well. Maybe give it another chance?
{% endhint %}

Vortex is a **mod manager** which will automate almost everything that you can fuck up when installing by hand. You will be able to see at first glance if a mod has been updated, and you can uninstall/delete your mods without losing data.

Once Vortex is [installed](./#0.-download-and-login), you can add mods directly from Nexus. The downloaded files will be kept inside the **staging** directory rather than in the game directory itself; you need to [**install**](./#1.-install-a-mod)**,** [**enable**](./#2.-enabling) and [**deploy**](./#3.-deploying) them if you want them to become active. Fortunately, this process is extremely simple.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, Vortex will convert everything you download to a REDmod, as this is how it maintains load order.&#x20;

* If you have no idea whether or not you want this, leave it alone.
* If you have a good reason not to want this, see [here](./#4.-optional-deactivate-redmod-conversion).
{% endhint %}

#### 0. Download and login

1. Download the mod manager from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), then log in to your Nexus account.
2. Set a Mod Staging folder (if it doesn't ask you, open Settings/Mods). **This is where Vortex stores its files**, so do not put it into the game directory.
3. Add Cyberpunk 2077: the executable is in the game directory under `/bin/x64/Cyberpunk2077.exe`

#### 1. Install a mod

On the mod's page, click the "Vortex" button under "Download":

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-mods-vortex.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If there isn't one, browse to the "Files" tab and look for the "Mod Manager Download" button.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-mods-vortex-2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If neither of these options are available, the mod author has chosen not to support Vortex. You can still try to download the archive, then **drag and drop** it on the running Vortex client.

If that doesn't work, you have to install it [**by hand**](./#by-hand).

#### 2. Enabling

By default, mods you install via Vortex will be **disabled**. To add them to Cyberpunk, you need to enable them.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-vortex-enabling-mods.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Although they're installed, Vortex will ignore all these mods until you tell it otherwise.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### 3. Deploying

{% hint style="warning" %}
Instead of cluttering your game directory, Vortex keeps everything in its **staging** folder until you're good to go. Here's how you give it the go:

* launch the game via Vortex&#x20;
* hit the **deploy** button.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-vortex-deploy.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Vortex will give you an error message if any of your mods couldn't be deployed successfully.&#x20;

#### 4. (optional) Deactivate REDmod conversion

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should only do this if you run into problems with your mods. By default, this setting works fine.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-vortex-convert-redmod.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 5. Troubleshooting

For problems that are related directly to Vortex, you can use [Nexus support](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Category:Vortex) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/redmodding) and find (volunteer) help in the #vortex-support channel.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before your mods **deploy**, there is no need to consult the [general troubleshooting](../../modding-know-how/user-guide-troubleshooting/).
{% endhint %}

### M[^1]anual install

"Manual install" is a rather glorified term for "extracting the downloaded archive into your game directory". **However**, you have to make sure that the right files end up in the right folders.&#x20;

You can inspect the file structure by simply opening the downloaded file, or by using this feature on Nexus (unless a mod author has disabled it):

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-nexus-preview-file-structure (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The file structure is different for REDmods and non-REDmods. Mod authors usually tell you which file is which, though.&#x20;

### REDmod:

{% hint style="info" %}
If the downloaded archive contains an `info.json` and a folder named `archives`, you're dealing with a REDmod.
{% endhint %}

Extract the entire folder into `/mods/`. You should have `/mods/ModName` afterwards.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-redmod-preview.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Non-REDmod

In your archive, find the folders corresponding to [this overview](./#overview-of-mod-folders) and extract them directly to your game directory. Their content will be added to the already existing files, overwriting anything that needs to be replaced.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-gift-wrapping.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Anything else

Some mods are just a loose collection of files and it's up to you and the mod's install instructions to put them in the right place.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/installing-other.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As a rule of thumb: usually, but not always…

* `.archive` files go into `/archive/pc/mod/`
* `.xl` files go into `/archive/pc/mod/`
* `.reds` files go into `/r6/scripts/`
* .`lua` files go into a subfolder of `/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/`

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems with Vortex, check the [corresponding section](./#5.-troubleshooting) of the guide.&#x20;

For everything else, this wiki has a dedicated [troubleshooting page](../../modding-know-how/user-guide-troubleshooting/) that has solutions to many common problems. If that doesn't cut it, you're welcome to find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/redmodding) in the #mod-troubleshooting channel (but your first answer will be a link to that guide).
